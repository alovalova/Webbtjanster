# Webbtjanster

This is a project made in the course "Storskaliga Webbtjänster" from Malmö university. On our website you can measure how long it takes you to fly to a place while waiting for PostNord to deliver a package from place A to place B.

Example: A package is going from Skurup to Kiruna. This takes approximately 2-3 working days. Our website will calculate how far you can go in the world by flight in 2-3 working days. (In 2-3 working days, you can travel from Singapore to Newark and back, with a little time left for a fika aswell.
